<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Carmelo Torres-Alverio, an aspiring web developer passionate about
  building engaging and functional digital experiences. My journey into web
  development began with a curiosity about how websites work, and now I’m
  actively learning to craft dynamic, user-friendly interfaces.
</p>

<p>
  I started by exploring the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m
  continually expanding my knowledge into frameworks and backend technologies.
  Whether it’s creating sleek user interfaces or optimizing website performance,
  I enjoy the problem-solving aspect of development.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, I’m focusing on front-end development, working with technologies
  like React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. I’m also diving into backend
  development, exploring Node.js and databases to build full-stack applications.
  My goal is to create intuitive, responsive websites that provide seamless user
  experiences.
</p>
<p>
  I’m actively working on projects that challenge me to think critically and
  apply what I learn. From simple landing pages to interactive web apps, I enjoy
  experimenting with new tools and improving my coding skills. My long-term goal
  is to become a skilled full-stack developer and contribute to innovative web
  solutions.
</p>
<p>
  I love connecting with other developers, sharing ideas, and collaborating on
  projects. If you're into coding, design, or just want to chat about web
  development, feel free to reach out!
